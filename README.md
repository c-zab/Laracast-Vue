# Laracast-vue

Laracast-vue is a project inspired in the Laracast serie [Learn Vue 2: Step By Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step). Every episode code is listed in different branches in this repository.


From episode 1 to 17 it is built using vue-cli, since episode 18 `Jeffrey Way` started working on top on Laravel (which I think is cool).


## Episodes 1 - 17

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Plugins

Laracast-vue is currently extended with the following external libraries. I recommend to install them or remove them from the `package.json` to avoid problems.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| ESLint | [eslint.org][PlEs] |
| Babel-eslint | [babel/babel-eslint][PlBa] |

## Episodes 18 - XX

Happy coding!
